### üî≠ I'm currently working on
* Developing a **Sailing Simulator** using **Unity** and deploying it with Steam, itch.io, WebGL (for the web), the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store.
* Diving deeper into **Laravel** which is the utilized framework, **C#** for the programming logic, **FireBase** for the data storage.
* Actively contributing to many different educational events for the youth regarding sailing and how a game is being made. Additonally, as a Intructor at SDU, I contribute to teaching Object-Oriented Programming Advanded-Oriented Programming, Web Technologies and manage and guide groups of software students in their Semester Projects. Lastly, I take part in events at SDU like CyberSecurityDK event or the Study Start for new students.

### ‚ú® My academic work & projects
**5th Semester** -- Currently
* Developing a full-stack **Scalable Website**. This is a website for the clients of Waterless Company to display the usage of Urinals. This website communicates with a micro-controller to gather and display data, stores data in a database, sends email notifications and uses User Authentication.
* Diving deeper into **React VITE** to create the FrontEnd, **Firebase** for the data storage, **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** as the programming languages for the logic, **Vercel** to deploy the website and **Microcontrollers** to gather and send data based on the usage of the Urinals.

**4th Semester**
* Created a full-stack **Scalable Website**. This is a book reccomendation website, that utilizes User Authentication, **AI and Machine Learning** to reccomend books based on favourited books for an individual.
* Utilizing **Django** as the framework, Importing data from a provided database, **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python with Django** as the programming languages.

**3th Semester**
* Developed a full-stack **Application & Scalable Website**. This is a automated electric-table system, that stores each employees personal preferences on table heights, sets physical tables heights according to employees preferences, gives health statistics and recommendations. Includes User Authentication to distinguis between a User and a Admin for different permissions. Additonally a application was developed to help employees have an easier time to pre-set their table heights and for Administrators to display the overview of employees preferences and health statistics.
* Using **Laravel** as the framework, **Unity** for the application, **C# with Unity, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP with Laravel** as the programming languages, **Pico Board** in order to flash lights on tables when a notification arrives and play sounds.

**2nd Semester**
* Made a **Application**. This is a application that displays statistics. This application serves the purpose to display and graph out the statistics and usages of heating for Danfoss.
* Utilizing **Avalonia** as the framework,**C#** as the programming language and **.NET**.

**1st Semester**
* Created a **Text based game**. This was a text based game for the user to play.
* Used **C#** as the programming language and **.NET**.

### üí° Interests & Focus Areas
My interests extend beyond traditional full-stack development into specialized technical fields, which I explore through academic contributions and personal projects:

* **Cyber Security (Defensive & Offensive):** Actively participating in events (like **CyberSecurityDK**) focused on implementing and testing security protocols to build **resilient, scalable websites** and applications.
* **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:** Implementing core ML concepts for **recommendation systems** (as seen in the 4th Semester project) and continually seeking ways to integrate predictive modeling into application logic.
* **Automation:** Using scripting and microcontrollers (like the **Pico Board** and other **Microcontrollers**) to automate real-world and software processes, enhancing system efficiency and reliability.
* **Networking:** Building and managing system architecture that supports communication between applications, microcontrollers, and databases to ensure **scalable** and seamless data flow.
